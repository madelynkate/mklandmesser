Hi, I’m @mklandmesser

I have acquired a BS in Computer Science from West Virginia University. 
I have taken several courses that helped me develop my understanding of software engineering, 
algorithms, and much more. My studies and my internship at NASA IV&V as a Software Engineer Intern helped 
develop my skills. I am interested in a job in the software engineering realm and I am eager to get my career started.

I’m currently learning HTML & CSS. Checkout my very first website here: https://mklandmesser.github.io/landmesser.github.io/
